# Company-system
The objective of this project was to develop comprehensive software for equipment management (sales), billing, and employee management. Pool was implemented, along with a load testing option—that is, it is possible to check the seconds of several executions being performed at the same time by a number X of people. 
The project was developed in C#, in Visual Studio 2022. I used my database in MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE.
